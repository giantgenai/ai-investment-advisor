Cosm uses a dynamic pricing model, similar to concerts or live sports."What's so unique about a property like the NFL is that fandom is everywhere," said Jeb Terry, president and CEO at Cosm. "We see fans coming in wearing jerseys, bringing the Terrible Towel, bringing cow bells, having an absolute blast, like they're at the stadium themselves."The company did not disclose the financial details of its deal with the NFL.Cosm offer a wide range of live sports and also educational programmingCourtesy: CosmCosm first opened its doors in Los Angeles and Dallas this summer and recently announced its third venue would be in downtown Atlanta, with future locations to be announced soon.Cosm already has deals in place with the NBA, UFC, ESPN, NBC Sports, TNT Sports, Fox Sports and Amazon Prime Video, and broadcasts everything from the Summer Olympics in Paris to the current World Series.Tickets for the first game of the World Series featuring the Los Angeles Dodgers and the New York Yankees sold out in seven minutes, Cosm said. The second game sold out in one minute."Inventory is flying off the shelf," Terry said.The shared reality experience gives fans the feeling of being at the game.Courtesy: CosmWhile live sports act as the core anchor for Cosm, the company also has nonsports offerings, including an animated voyage beyond the planets through the eyes of astronauts and a Cirque du Soleil show. This allows the company to have programs throughout lunch and matinee hours when live sports may not be available.As fans' viewing habits are changing, Cosm is finding rapid success in its tech-forward model.Terry said the venues are already seeing repeat customers and they will soon be introducing membership rewards and season passes.In July, the company raised more than $250 million in funding to expand globally. Cosm is valued at more than $1 billion, and its investors include sports heavyweights such as former Milwaukee Bucks owner Marc Lasry, Cleveland Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert and co-managing partner of the Philadelphia 76ers and the New Jersey Devils David Blitzer.Disclosure: Comcast owns NBCUniversal, the parent company of CNBC.Don’t miss these insights from CNBC PROGoldman forecasts just a 3% S&P 500 annual return the next 10 years, down from 13% the last decadeAs gold hits another record high, the pros reveal their outlook for the precious metalBank of America hikes Nvidia price target, says shares can rally almost 40%10 analysts just hiked their price targets on these 3 stocks — including a Big Tech AI firmwatch nowVIDEO2:1702:17Cosm raises $250 million in funding roundSquawk on the Street
