Bloomberg earlier reported the talks.Nothing has been signed and there is no timeline for a potential deal, the person added.The Miami Dolphins and the NFL declined to comment, and Tsai's BSE Global did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Businessman Stephen Ross purchased the Miami Dolphins in 2009 for $1.1 billion.A source close to the Miami Dolphins owner said Ross plans to use the money from the sale to increase his portfolio of South Florida real estate and further his investment in sports.Ross, also the CEO of Related Companies, is just one of a handful of team owners that also owns and operates the team's stadium. This allows him to bring in revenue from events held at the stadium such as the Miami Grand Prix and Miami Open tennis tournament.The Dolphins made $673 million in revenue in 2023.Earlier this year, Ross reportedly turned down a record $10 billion offer for control of the team, Formula One Miami Grand Prix and Hard Rock Stadium. Ross said he wanted to keep the team within his family.watch nowVIDEO3:1903:19Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross nears stake saleSquawk BoxIn late August, NFL owners voted in favor of allowing select private equity firms to invest up to a 10% stake in teams.The NFL is the last of the major professional sports to allow PE investment, but the league softened its stance as rising valuations have made finding buyers increasingly difficult.Ares, which manages $450 billion in assets, was one of the four groups that the NFL approved for investment in its teams.Meanwhile, Tsai has been building a sports empire.
