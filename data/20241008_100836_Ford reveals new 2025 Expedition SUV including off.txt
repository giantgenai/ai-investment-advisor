And with those insights we've rethought and redesigned Expedition to help customers make the most of their precious time with family and to make life easier — before, during and after every trip they make," said Trevor Scott, general manager of Ford Utilities.Ford said the 2025 Expedition will start around $63,000, including destination charges, when the vehicles will arrive in dealerships in the spring. That's more than $5,000 higher than the 2024 model, but still less than the $70,000 average transaction price of current vehicles.2025 Ford Expedition Platinum UltimateFordThe last time the vehicle was redesigned seven years ago, its main competition was full-size SUVs from Ford's crosstown rival General Motors, such as the Chevrolet Tahoe, Chevrolet Suburban and GMC Yukon.While GM's vehicles continue to lead the segment, new competitors such as the Jeep Wagoneer from Stellantis as well as large three-row crossovers from Kia and Hyundai have also come to market.Auto data and insights firm Edmunds.com reports three-row crossovers such as the Kia Telluride and Hyundai Palisade, which are smaller but cost less than Ford's current Expeditions, represent the top cross-shopped vehicle segment of full-size SUVs.Edmunds reports the mainstream full-size SUV segment that includes the Expedition has grown to represent 2.7% of the U.S. market this year, up from 2% in 2017. Segment sales totaled roughly 312,500 units through September of this year.2025 Ford Expedition TremorFordFord also has shifted the models for the 2025 Expedition to Active, Platinum (including an "Ultimate" version), King Ranch and Tremor. The off-road inspired Tremor is new for the Expedition but is available on other vehicles.The Expedition will continue to be available in a standard version or longer "Max" model. It will be powered by a 3.5-liter EcoBoost V6 engine or a high-output version of the engine with 440 horsepower and 510 foot-pounds of torque.
