It's set to retail starting at $94,900. Other models are expected to follow, including an entry-level $79,900 Gravity Touring trim late next year."I'm very confident we'll enjoy significant step change in demand for our products, our complete product portfolio," Rawlinson told CNBC. "We believe there's about a 6-to-1 ratio … for the SUV over sedan, and that's going to put us in a very strong position."Lucid Gravity Grand Touring SUVLucidA six-times sales multiplier for the Gravity over the Air would be significant for the company, which has struggled with market awareness and customer demand compared with Wall Street's expectations and its own initial expectations.Lucid delivered 7,142 Air sedans to customers through the third quarter of this year, topping its roughly 6,000 vehicles delivered in 2023.Rawlinson said the company, which is backed by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, expects customer demand to initially outpace production, as the automaker ramps up output at its sole U.S. plant in Arizona.Lucid expects to begin serial production of the Gravity for customers by the end of this year, but Rawlinson declined to disclose when customer deliveries are expected to begin.Lucid Gravity Grand Touring SUV (left) and Lucid Air sedan EVsLucidRawlinson said the company is still finalizing federal crash testing, a self-certification process, as well as awaiting range testing from the Environmental Protection Agency, followed by the California Air Resources Board.Shares of Lucid have been under pressure this year, down roughly 40% as EV demand has been slower than expected.
