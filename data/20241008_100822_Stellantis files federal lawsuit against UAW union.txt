He called it and other actions by the company "desperate actions from a desperate executive who has lost control.""Our legal team has complete confidence in our right to strike. The company's legal threats are just that—threats intended to intimidate us, so we won't fight back," Fain said.The dispute between the two sides centers on the union alleging Stellantis has not kept contractual obligations as part of a deal the two sides reached late last year. It comes after Stellantis has made several cuts to plant production, conducted worker layoffs and delayed potential investments outlined as part of the 2023 contract.Fain has routinely said the union will strike if needed, however Stellantis has argued that would be unlawful under the contract.The automaker has contended that there's language in the contract that gives it leniency to change plans based on market conditions, plant performance and other factors.The company reiterated that stance in its lawsuit and cited "Letter 311," which includes the company's expected investments: "The planned future investments in the letter are conditional, require Company approval, and are subject to change based on these business factor contingencies."The lawsuit came the same day Fain and union members held their latest rally against Stellantis in suburban Detroit."We're here today for one reason. Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares is out of control and it's once again up to UAW members to save this company from itself," Fain said during the event. "A strike will cripple this company. And if we have to strike, it's Stellantis' decision to do so because they are not honoring their commitment."The union and several local chapters have filed grievances against the automaker regarding contract obligations and other issues.Stellantis, in the lawsuit, called the grievances a sham designed to "justify mid-contract strikes against Stellantis that otherwise would violate the [contract's] no strike clause."Don’t miss these insights from CNBC PROHow Warren Buffett decides when to sell a stock, and why he might be dumping Bank of AmericaThis is the cost of carrying too much cash, according to Wells FargoChinese stocks are on fire, and this sector is poised to benefitDavid Tepper's big bet after the Fed rate cut was to buy 'everything' related to China
