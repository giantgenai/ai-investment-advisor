Rival Airbus has delivered 447 airplanes this year through August,Last month's deliveries were led by 27 of Boeing's bestselling 737 Max aircraft to customers including United Airlines, which received five, and Ryanair and Southwest Airlines, which each each took three. Deliveries are key to Boeing. It's already burned through more than $8 billion this year since customers pay the bulk of the price when they receive the airplane.The aircraft are produced in Renton, Washington, one of the factories where machinists walked off the job on Sept. 13 after workers overwhelmingly voted down a tentative agreement the company had reached with their union. The two sides are back at the negotiating table this week, though the union dismissed a sweetened offer from Boeing last month.Read more CNBC airline newsBoeing machinists on picket lines prepare for lengthy strike: 'I can last as long as it takes'How fixing airplane engines became a $58 billion businessSouthwest Airlines to cut service and staffing in Atlanta to slash costsAll but 10 of the 27 Maxes were handed over before the strike began, according to Jefferies aerospace analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu.
