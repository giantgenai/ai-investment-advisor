<!-- ## Overview
The AI Image Classifier app enables users to upload an image and receive a classification from various categories like 'Dog', 'Cat', 'Car', etc. This is useful for quickly categorizing large datasets of images. -->

## Features
- **News Scraping:** The application scrapes financial news from sources like CNBC and Yahoo Finance. It uses python libraries `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to fetch and parse web content. The scraped articles are saved locally with metadata like title, source, and timestamp.
- **Investment Recommendation:** The app uses a language model to analyze news summaries and recommend investments. The companies news are scraped and summarized by `Crawl4ai`'s `LLMExtractionStrategy` with options of using `OpenAI's GPT models` or `Ollama's LLaMA 3` model, which is compatible with OpenAI's API format but runs locally.
- **Local LLM Integration:** The app is configured to use `Ollama's LLaMA models locally`, leveraging their OpenAI-compatible API. This setup involves running a local server and using a placeholder API key ('ollama'), which is required but not used for authentication.
