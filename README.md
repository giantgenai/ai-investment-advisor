<!-- ## Overview
The AI Image Classifier app enables users to upload an image and receive a classification from various categories like 'Dog', 'Cat', 'Car', etc. This is useful for quickly categorizing large datasets of images. -->

## Features
- **News Scraping:** The application scrapes financial news from sources like CNBC and Yahoo Finance. It uses python libraries `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to fetch and parse web content. The scraped articles are saved locally with metadata like title, source, and timestamp.
- **Investment Recommendation:** The app uses a language model to analyze news summaries and recommend investments. The companies news are scraped and summarized by `Crawl4ai`'s `LLMExtractionStrategy` with options of using `OpenAI's GPT models` or `Ollama's LLaMA 3` model, which is compatible with OpenAI's API format but runs locally.
- **Local LLM Integration:** The app is configured to use `Ollama's LLaMA models locally`, leveraging their OpenAI-compatible API. This setup involves running a local server and using a placeholder API key ('ollama'), which is required but not used for authentication.

## Dependencies
### Required Software
- **Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.9 or later installed on your system. You can download Python from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Ollama**: A tool for running LLM locally. You can download Ollama from the offical [Ollama website](https://ollama.com/). 

### OpenAI API Key
If you want to use OpenAI GPT models, please ensure you have the OpenAI API Key set up in your environment.
1. Obtain your API Key

   Go to [OpenAIâ€™s API Key page](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
   Log in and create a new API key if you haven't already.
2. Set Up the API Key in Your Environment

   **Linux/macOS:** 

   Open your terminal and add the key to your `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, or `.zshrc file`:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```
   Then, reload your shell configuration by running:
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc  # or `source ~/.zshrc` if you used .zshrc
   ```
   **Windows:** 

   Open Command Prompt and set the environment variable:
   ```bash
   setx OPENAI_API_KEY "your-api-key-here"
   ```
   You may need to restart your terminal or IDE to access the variable.
